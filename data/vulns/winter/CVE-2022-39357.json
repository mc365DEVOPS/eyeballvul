  "details": "Winter is a free, open-source content management system based on the Laravel PHP framework. The Snowboard framework in versions 1.1.8, 1.1.9, and 1.2.0 is vulnerable to prototype pollution in the main Snowboard class as well as its plugin loader. The 1.0 branch of Winter is not affected, as it does not contain the Snowboard framework. This issue has been patched in v1.1.10 and v1.2.1. As a workaround, one may avoid this issue by following some common security practices for JavaScript, including implementing a content security policy and auditing scripts.",
